These are examples of projects I have worked on as part of No Code AI and ML executive certification program from MIT. The datasets were provided by the program.

Project 1: Hotel Cancellation Prediction: Evaluates Decision Trees and Random Forests models to predict whether a reservation would be cancelled or not.
