**These are two projects I have worked on as part of <ins>No Code AI and ML: Building Data Science Solutions executive certification program from MIT.</ins>** Datasets were provided by the program.

**Project 1: Hotel Cancellation Prediction**: Evaluates Decision Trees and Random Forests models to predict whether a reservation would be cancelled or not.
